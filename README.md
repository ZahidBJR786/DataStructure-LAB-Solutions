# 📘 Data Structure Lab (C++)

Welcome to the **Data Structure Lab**  a focused repository where I explore key low-level concepts in **C++**, specifically:

- 🧭 **Pointers**
- 🧩 **Function Pointers**
- 🧠 **Dynamic Memory Allocation**

These are the fundamental tools behind data structure implementation and memory-efficient programming in C++.

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside

This repository is structured to walk through C++ concepts that closely interact with memory, the stack and heap, and indirect function handling.

### Covered Topics

- **Pointers in C++**
  - Pointer basics, arithmetic, and dereferencing
  - Pointers to arrays, objects, and functions
- **Function Pointers**
  - Storing functions as first-class entities
  - Callback mechanisms using function pointers
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
  - Using `new` and `delete` for object and array memory management
  - Manual memory handling vs. smart pointers (as a glimpse into modern C++)

Let me know if you'd like to:

- Include example output/screenshots
- Include a CMake configuration
- Convert it into a GitHub Pages-friendly format

I'm happy to help further!
